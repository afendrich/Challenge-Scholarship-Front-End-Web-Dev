			<p class="animal-description">Wolves live in groups called packs. A pack is a family of 7-8 wolves with a mom, dad, and offspring. The wolves' communication skills are very important to the pack's survival. Wolves work together to hunt, raise their young, and protect their territory. Wolves communicate with more than howls. They whimper and whine, growl and bark, yelp and snarl. They also use scents produced by their bodies to communicate.   </p>
